Define a subquery named A:
  From tables COSTING as CT, CONSOL as C, CONSOL_CNTR as CC, TRADER as T,
    Extract fields COM_ID, CSL_ID, CNTR_ID, COST_C, COST_DESC, COST_RATE, COST_UNIT, COST_QTY, 
      NVL(COST_TERM, 'FP') as COST_TERM, PARTY_ID, COST_CURR, COST_EX_RATE, LOC_AMT, DOC_AMT, 
      DOC_TYPE, DOC_NO, POL_ID, POD_ID, POD, VESSEL, ETD_POL_D, ETA_POD_D, CNTR_SIZE, CNTR_TYPE, 
      T.NAME as PARTY_NAME, ETA_ETD_NO.
    The extracted data must satisfy several conditions:
      C.COM_ID should be '010'
      C.JOB_TYPE should be 'CS'
      CT.COM_ID should be equal to C.COM_ID
      CT.CSL_ID should be equal to C.CSL_ID
      C.COST_CENTER should be 'E'
      CT.COM_ID should be equal to CC.COM_ID
      CT.CNTR_ID should be equal to CC.CNTR_ID
      CT.PARTY_ID should be equal to T.PARTY_ID
      CT.COST_C should be 'OF-E-CT-CR'
      CT.COST_CURR should be 'USD'
      CT.BKG_NO should be NULL

Then, from the result of subquery A:
  Group by COM_ID, CSL_ID, ETA_ETD_NO, CNTR_ID, COST_TERM,
    Extract fields COM_ID, CSL_ID, ETA_ETD_NO, CNTR_ID, COST_TERM,
    And for each group, extract the following:
      The maximum of PARTY_ID as PARTY_ID
      The maximum of PARTY_NAME as PARTY_NAME
      The maximum of POD_ID as POD_ID
      The maximum of POD as POD
      The maximum of ETD_POL_D as ETD_POL_D
      The maximum of CNTR_SIZE as CNTR_SIZE
      The maximum of CNTR_TYPE as CNTR_TYPE
      The absolute sum of COST_RATE as RATE
